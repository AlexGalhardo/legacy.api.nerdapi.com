</div>

## Live Demo: <https://microsaas.alexgalhardo.com>

## Introduction

*   This is the backend code from Galhardo MicroSaaS
*   This is personal project and challenge I created to learn ReactJS with Typescript using Single Page Applications (SPA) principles, to see if I could program a microsaas MVP within a week.
*   This project uses JWT tokens using stateless authentication.
*   BackEnd is a simple Typescript code using Express REST API endpoints using Clean Architecture Principles (ports, useCases, etc)
*   I choosed to save data in a JSON as database for simplicity and development velocity reasons.

## Git Conventional Commits

*   You can learn more here: <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>

*   We highly recommend you to use this pattern to make git commits in this code repository

*   test:
    *   Indicates any type of creation or alteration of test codes.
    *   Example: Creating unit tests.

*   feat:
    *   Indicates the development of a new feature to the project. Example: Addition of a service, functionality, endpoint, etc.

*   refactor:
    *   Used when there is a code refactoring that does not have any impact on the system's business logic/rules. - Example: Code changes after a code review

*   style:
    *   Used when there are formatting and style changes to the code that do not change the system in any way.
    *   Example: Change style-guide, change lint convention, fix indentations, remove whitespace, remove comments, etc..

*   fix:
    *   Used when correcting errors that are generating bugs in the system.
    *   Example: Applying handling to a function that is not having the expected behavior and returning an error.

*   chore:
    *   Indicates changes to the project that do not affect the system or test files. These are developmental changes.
    *   Example: Change eslint rules, add prettier, add more file extensions to .gitignore

*   docs:
    *   Used when there are changes in the project's documentation.
    *   Example: add information in the API documentation, change the README, etc.

*   build:
    *   Used to indicate changes that affect the project's build process or external dependencies.
    *   Example: Gulp, add/remove npm dependencies, etc.

*   perf:
    *   Indicates a change that improved system performance.
    *   Example: change ForEach to while, improve the database query, etc.

*   ci:
    *   Used for changes in CI configuration files.
    *   Example: Circle, Travis, BrowserStack, etc.

*   revert:

## Git Branch Names

*   We highly recommend you to use this pattern to make git branchs in this code repository
*   main
    *   Most stable version of the software that is in production
*   staging
    *   Most up-to-date version of the software that is in the staging/testing environment before going to production, used for end-to-end testing
*   feature/feature\_name\_here
    *   Branch created to start implementing a new feature
*   bugfix/bug\_name\_here
    *   Branch created for bug fixing
*   hotfix/hotfix\_summary\_here
    *   Branch created to fix urgent bugs that appeared in production
*   refactor/refactor\_summary\_here
    *   Branch created to refactor code, edit and delete different files, without changing the behavior of the software or adding any new functionality
*   docs/summary\_here
    *   Branch created with main purpose of improving and editing documentations (Swagger, Markdowns, etc)
